{150}{250} Fingers smoothed upon thy flesh | A dance of decadent delights
{251}{350} The scent of heated pleasures | does wake the beast from within.
{440}{550} Be not deceived by earthly wants, | a winsome gaze or comely face.
{551}{660} Turn away from stirring passion, | speak not of lustful thoughts.
{730}{805} Let lesser men breed and cavort | in the throngs of harlots' clutches.
{806}{880} Those of the builder's mind | have greater works to commence.
{880}{940} - Hammer Book of Tenets, | chapter IV, verse III
{965}{1180} The note in the Free Trader’s vault mentioned Gorman Truart | – or Norman Druart as he likes to call himself 
{1190}{1350} – frequenting a brothel in the City the 2nd night of every week, carrying his diary.
{1360}{1575} Apparently it’s filthy and cheap enough to ward off any | rich nobles or influentials he might accidentally bump into. 
{1580}{1690} Ha even if any of these fat cats did see each other, 
{1692}{1840} they would pretend it never happened, at least until one was ready to blackmail the other.
{1850}{1995} Unfortunately for Truart, I’m not one of those fat cats…
{2000}{2190} Truart has really been cracking down on prostitution in the City, | or so I’ve heard in my short time here. 
{2192}{2350} This means I should be able to find some means of exposing him and use it as leverage for information.
{2352}{2425} I’ve got to find that book Neeson mentioned.
{2435}{2600} If it’s as detailed as Neeson said it would be, it should have some record of Kedar and what has become of him. 
{2605}{2690} I’ll grab it before I’m noticed, and then get out.
{2695}{2880} The book should have some dirt on the good sheriff as well, | but I think I’ve done enough exposing criminals for the time being.
{2890}{3100} I couldn’t care less about the morality of this corrupt city’s leaders and politicians, | I just want to find Kedar…
