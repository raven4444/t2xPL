{140}{249} Those who lead by way of broken bone | and clenched iron fist
{250}{350} Will see themselves fall to ruin | through blindness and pride.
{420}{650} Those who choose | the wisdom of the cog, | abandoning the feckless relics | of the past,
{700}{810} Will live to see | the builder's glory reneved, stepping from the shadows of this age | into a new dawn.
{812}{930} -Mechanist Prophecy IV, book 2
{1035}{1155} I used to stand on the bow of my ship sometimes and stare across the water, 
{1157}{1270} imagining what new sights and experiences might await me in the City.
{1320}{1450} I was so naive back then… a child…
{1480}{1550} Soon it will begin.
{1580}{1680} The deception will be over and Kedar avenged… 
{1705}{1890} I trust Cavador to get up early, | so hopefully this mess will over before anyone innocent gets hurt.
{1920}{2080} I figure Free Traders would rather run like the cowards they are, rather than fight,
{2081}{2222} but if my deception works, then they’re not going to have a chance.
{2226}{2285} They have ships docked somewhere inside…
{2300}{2380} and mine is among them from the way it sounds.
{2400}{2520} I’ll have to get a key from their shipping office safe to access the docks first.
{2537}{2620} I can’t wait to find it and get out of this evil place.
{2630}{2710} It’s as hollow as the people who inhabit it.
{2730}{2880} I’ll have to wait until the fight begins to get inside again, | and I’ll have to move quickly.
{2894}{3030} If I wait too long, the Hammerites might claim some of the booty for themselves.
