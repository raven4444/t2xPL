{140}{375} Retribution | A precise Tool in the hands | Of the Righteous | for the wayward find penance | by the vengance of enemies
{420}{645} But workman beware | the sharp edge of justice | lest thy tool be turned | on thyself
{725}{940} And Wounds layed open | which death cannot heal | - Hammer Tenet
{965}{1000} The Hammerites.
{1065}{1232} Apparently not very popular in the City, but it looks like they’re the law here in Sunnyport. 
{1245}{1385} If there is any such thing as true law in this land of infidels…
{1400}{1525} Some new group called the Mechanists seem to be running them out of the City recently,
{1528}{1720} so the Hammers have retreated to some of these little out of the way towns like | Sunnyport where they appear to be thriving.
{1745}{1840} These guys, however, seem to have been here for some time.
{1858}{2120} I don’t know or care much about these strange religions or their practices, | but these Hammers may be just the thing to take care of my smuggler friends.
{2142}{2290} They don’t seem the type that would tolerate a slave trade | or art smuggling in their happy little town.
{2366}{2512} I tried to find a way into the rear compound, but it looks to be off limits to initiates.
{2535}{2618} I’ll just have to break in the front and see what I can find. 
{2645}{2868} I don’t have a plan yet, but there’s got to be some way to alert these | fanatics to all the illegal activity going on under their ugly noses.
{2870}{2925} If they catch sight of me I’m dead. 
{2940}{3215} I get the feeling they don’t tolerate visitors, especially foreign women, | but I’d sure like to see them bring those heavy sledgehammers down on Kedar’s murderers.
