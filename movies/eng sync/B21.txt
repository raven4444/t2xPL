{210}{320} Suffer not a tree in thy way | When a path is to be made.

{980}{1115} I found a few notes back at Kedar's place talking about someplace called 'Sunnyport'.
{1130}{1210} It sounded like these smugglers have some sort of a base there. 
{1215}{1410} Malak tells me it's a town overlooking the coast where all | the nobility go to get away from all the foul City air. 
{1425}{1625} Sounds a little odd calling them “nobility,” but | I suppose Cream's not the only thing that rises to the top.
{1640}{1760} Malak's about the only half-noble person I've met in this city.
{1800}{1990} He says there's something called a 'Steam Carriage' | which goes from the City to Sunnyport every day.
{1995}{2200} He says it can pull ten carriages as fast as a whole train of horses can pull one. | I don't think he approves.
{2240}{2460} I had a wander around the station today, | but there are lots of areas out of bounds to the public | and you can't get near the Carriage without a ticket.
{2478}{2550} Tickets cost far more than I can afford right now.
{2570}{2710} Today I'm going to find a way on board the train and follow the smugglers to their stop. 
{2720}{2945} Sounds easy, but by the looks of the decorations there's quite a lot of money in that place, | so I can expect it to be heavily guarded.
{2955}{3110} I somehow doubt the smugglers will just invite me in, | so I'll need a bit of money for equipment once I'm there. 
{3125}{3300} I suppose this is as good a place as any to get that. | I didn't want to become a thief, 
{3302}{3510} but Malak says this is the only way and | I can't think of anything better, so here goes.
