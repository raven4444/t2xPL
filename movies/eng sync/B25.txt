{150}{250} When the Builder | Commanded the early brethren | to let the unrighteous guide them,
{251}{351} The brothers lay the skins of the thief | into fire, | and with his charred bones make a haft,
{420}{550} and dids they hew the four limbs | of the murderer | and use his biding skull for a head
{551}{670} with the flesh of the diseased harlot | didst they forge the fires of the smelter,
{740}{839} and with the hammer | that was forged betwixt them | did the righteous strike down
{840}{940} many of their unholy brethren | - hammer book of tenets, verse 29
{960}{1150} I’m not exactly sure what this Orb does, but it seems to have suddenly become very important to a lot of people.
{1165}{1280} Especially me…  | First things first. 
{1285}{1400} I’ll plant the Orb in the smuggler’s innocent little candy shop. 
{1410}{1550} Looks like a few of them have a sweet tooth tonight, | so I may have to find another way in.
{1560}{1700} Next I’ll sneak back to the Hammer Cathedral to leave a little anonymous note for Bishop Cavador.
{1720}{1860} I scouted around earlier and found the secret entrance Onam was supposed to use.
{1866}{1955} I can drop the note on his desk and be gone before I’m noticed.
{1965}{2158} Once they discover the stolen Orb, the Hammers will rip this town apart looking for Feredoc and his bunch. 
{2165}{2300} Even better, they’ll blame the smugglers for the disappearance of Priest Onam and the others.
{2302}{2345} I’d better get to work. 
{2355}{2468} The sooner I can get this done, the more assured I will be of revenge.  
{2473}{2630} I should be safe traveling through the town;  | the watch guards probably won’t stop or question me along the way.
{2650}{2840} But I can’t afford to draw attention to myself, | and I’ll have to be very careful not to be seen by any of the smugglers.
