{210}{315} Of the counyless ways | in which to lose one's balance, 
{320}{430} The pursuit of vengeance | eclipses most others.
{580}{720} Luring the unwary from his path, | turning the willful into a weapon,
{730}{810} And leading the fool | to embrace his own undoing.

{990}{1130} I ran away. I ran Away... 
{1200}{1380} Tonight, I stop running. Tonight my retribution begins. 
{1382}{1455} It's been more than a year since Kedar...
{1500}{1720} Since he died… | they let me escape, and soon they'll pay for that mistake. 
{1760}{1890} I must have patience. I could try to kill as many of them as I could.
{1900}{1993} I might even get two or three, before they caught me.
{2000}{2110} But that’s not enough. In a month it would mean nothing. 
{2120}{2180} They don't care about each other.
{2184}{2370} I've asked around a little. | No one in this tourist trap seems to know anything about the smugglers on their doorstep. 
{2415}{2657} I wonder if I can use that...| There are two things the thief fears; being robbed, or getting caught robbing someone else.
{2675}{2815} Hopefully I can use both fears against the Free Traders during my stay. 
{2845}{2984} I met with an associate of Malak's here in Sunnyport this afternoon and bought everything I need,
{2986}{3190} so tonight I'm going to try and sneak into their base of operations and steal both their wealth and their secrecy.
{3220}{3370} If what I’ve learned is true, the Smugglers have a hideout somewhere in an underground cave system.
{3380}{3520} I’ll sneak into their base through the secret cave entrance I saw earlier and see what I can find. 
{3568}{3688} Kedar, forgive me for not doing anything before…
{3730}{3825} Linjala give me courage for what I must do now.
