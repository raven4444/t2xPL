{220}{325} Lays you down among the unmovings | to rest unbidden exposers your bonesies.
{330}{450} Wiggling, crawling, cavorting | those wormsies and maggots and beetles.
{570}{680} Lays you back, | dries your fine bloodsies
{685}{785} Lays you back, | down among the deadsies.

{955}{1160} These Hammerites, from what I can tell, are extremely fanatical, | and apparently just as hypocritical… 
{1165}{1305} Apparently these self-righteous gasbags are losing their foothold in the City.
{1312}{1485} They seem to have quite a hold on Sunnyport, | but I get the sense they’re worried that what’s happening in the City could happen here.
{1510}{1640} They decided to store all of their precious junk where no sane person would think to look...
{1670}{1795} in an old, abandoned mausoleum just outside of town.  
{1799}{1882} Out of sight, out of mind as they say…
{1885}{1980} Apparently though, the plan is back-firing on them.  
{2000}{2260} Cavador dispatched bishop Onam and some of his cronies a few weeks ago | to try to find this Orb of Saint Basthmus, | and none of them have returned.
{2275}{2390} It sounds like the place has become too fraught with undead for a head on assault.
{2415}{2480} I guess I can’t blame them for trying.
{2495}{2700} The Hammers believe the Orb, if properly used, | might give them power to overcome these Mechanists and their machines. 
{2710}{2840} At least… that’s the excuse that Cavador seems to have fed to Onam. 
{2860}{3040} Given that these two seem to be suspicious of one another, | I wouldn’t be surprised if the story was bogus.
{3047}{3183} But that doesn’t change the fact that | I need to make it down there myself if I’m going to get the Orb.  
{3200}{3400} If I can snag it, I should be able to use it to attract the hammers to the smugglers, | without attracting attention to myself.  
{3420}{3600} I have to get in there quickly, and get out even more quickly… | else I might end up like Onam and the others.
