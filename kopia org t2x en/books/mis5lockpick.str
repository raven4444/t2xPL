One of those damn briefcases from Rathran's place is locked tight. Jal, that dumb bugger, killed him before he could get the key. Don't know what's in there so we're going to need something subtle. You still keep that lockpick stored in the tower? We may need it tomorrow. The small one doesn't seem to work. Also, make sure you bring over that new set of whites we got from South Quarter. You know how the bosses like to distinguish themselves and all that.
