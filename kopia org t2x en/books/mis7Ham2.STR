page_0:      "     Brother Onam's wisdom shalt be our saving grace. For He setteth a plan to scout out the catacombs with the acolytes, by chance there is a way to secure our cache of holy relics in the Mausoleum.
     Our numbers are smaller now than at the beginning of our journey, however we hast managed to locate the entrance to the Mausoleum. The doors are locked, but Builder willing, the key lays wait somewhere in the crypts. Mayhap it sits in the unholy skull crypt where dear Brother Brayson was slain by a trap.
     It feels as if even now some unseen specter doth visit our quest, looking upon us from the shadows of this evil place. Now we sit and prepare for what is to come.

Brother Stalwerth"
