After some consideration, we of the brothers of the order have decided to comply with the Watch's belligerent requests to forward you a key. We know that certain institutions are required to give you a key for safety reasons, but quite frankly, we find the request for a key to our building insulting. We are not barbarians, and if it were not for our cleansing of the streets, the City Watch would have actual criminals to deal with on their patrol.

However, so that we do not cause a stir, we shall agree for the time being. But know that The Builder does not take kindly to those who carelessly guard the means of access to His Domain.

Brother Terrus"
