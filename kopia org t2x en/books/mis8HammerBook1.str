As men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow fire on it, so shall I gather my children to test them for a time. For one who is of you, yet not of you, shall rise from the flames to be a father to the fatherless, a husband to the widow, and a son to the childless. For the sloth of the hammer doth wax great, and my anger will not be quenched, lest this one rule for a time, that those who call upon my Name might remember me in their time of trial, and call to me in the day of their despair. Then I shall hear their voice, and shall deliver them from the hands that trust in gear, and forsake the wonders of the hammer, and the simplicity of the nail.\"
