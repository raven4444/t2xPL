"Dear M. Volari

Regarding the matter of your new electrical lighting system, we will be round next week to continue fashioning the fixings and conduits. In the meantime can we ask that no one be allowed near the generator area, as the power'd energy within is not yet safely harnessed and may result in hurtin' upon you or one of your pretty girls.

Yours,
Lester Mayrocke
