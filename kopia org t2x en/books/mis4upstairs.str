If you leave your smelly boots in here one more night I'm gonna throw you off the edge. The stench is enough to choke a Burrick. I know a good foot doctor over in Audale that could take a look at it for you if you'd like. Either way, I'm sick of sacking out in the vestibule downstairs to keep from gagging all night long. Either the boots go or you go.
