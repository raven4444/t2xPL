Page_0: "Carla,
I regret having to miss our weekend together. My time in the City is always short and my time with you even shorter than I desire. Please enjoy our accommodations at the Grand. I have a tab in both the bar and restaurant. I will contact you in Lesser Hrabota the next time I have travel plans that bring me close enough for us to meet. My thoughts are only for you, though it often doesn't show. Please forgive me.
Your honey bear,
Grant"
