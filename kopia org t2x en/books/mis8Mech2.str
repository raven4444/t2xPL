Page_0: "Brother Stibbons and Sister Adstan,
Thy work is holy, and should be revered as such. Even in Sunnyport doth the narrowness of the Hammerite beset the Builder's children, binding those who should serve Him with great liberty. Make thine way secret, yet close to the grounds of Lighthouse Cathedral, the foul womb of the Hammer doctrine. Use whatever means the Builder shall provide to gain knowledge of their weaknesses, for every great beast hath some frailty. Thus you shall pave the way for the teachings of Brother Karras, which will finally bring true light to dark Sunnyport.

For the glory of Karras (and the Builder),
Bishop Billet"
