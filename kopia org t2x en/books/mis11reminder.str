In addition to impeccably clean and resplendent surroundings (and our magnificent hotel certainly offers that) the sophisticated men and women of the jury will expect only the best in terms of staff behavior. So stay sharp and be ever at service. My reputation is at stake here! Pay raises for staff members are a distinct possibility if things go well.
