Hath Bookmaster Araphax been taken by the Trickster's demons? I called upon him two days past for assistance with a reading assignment from our Epistemological Harmitology course. He foisted upon me two entire volumes dealing with Sotieriological Doclestialism - and Non-Modalistic Doclestailism at that! Has the man completely lost all sense of reason?! He then proceeded to ramble on about the merits of Reformed Eschatalogical Revisionism in full hearing of all in the library. When I admonished him that our Order holds strictly to Revised Eschatalogical Progressivism, he angrily began listing every breakfast food he's eaten in the last two weeks. I urge you to speak with him, and recommend a formal inquiry into his doctrinal fortitude."
