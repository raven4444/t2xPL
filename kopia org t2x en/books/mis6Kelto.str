     I am greatly dismayed at the growing lack of Hammer security at the Silver Street carriage house! I have seen shady characters lurking about with increasing frequency. Just yesterday I confronted one of them myself and inquired as to his business here in Sunnyport. He simply sneered at me and suggested that I perform certain activities with myself that I assure you are anatomically impossible. Until you investigate these individuals further you will not be receiving my substantial monthly donation to your Order. I may be reached during business hours at the Foaming Dog Grille. 
Good day,
Mr. Kelto Talls"
