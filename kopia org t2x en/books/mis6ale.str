It is as you said. This town is filthy with tourists though much less so at this time of year, for the place is foggy and rainy. I had hoped to find some respite away from the politics of Mechanist vs. Hammerite but alas, it strikes forth even here! I swear I saw Brother Orec (the traitor!) wandering the streets, though he was not in his Hammerite attire. Perhaps he came seeking vacation. I followed him a ways but he disappeared off into a clothing store."

I shall be certain to send you a bottle of our best ale, since I know you like to keep some for long nights at study. That, at least, is something they do well here.

Sincerely,
Brother Horman"
