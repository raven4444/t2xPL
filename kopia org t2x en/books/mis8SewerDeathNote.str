Page_0: "Curse my rotten luck!
I am writing this since it may well be that I die down here. I slipped in some muck and have injured my back very badly. I can't feel my legs. I've been calling for help for what seems like days. It's hard to say how long it's been since time seems to stand still down here. I'm so hungry. I'm growing weak.

I should never have gone looking for those bandits that are rumored to be hiding down here. I just wanted to prove myself to you... my sweets. Oh fair Lady MacAlpine, how I wish only to see your face one last time.
