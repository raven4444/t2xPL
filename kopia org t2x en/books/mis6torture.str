     As to the full inquisition of young William, I have no doubts that his soul wast in league with the heretics. He spoke only of being a hired lackey, a simple matter of reporting the going's on in the Cathedral, but I suspect his devotion ran much deeper. I extracted very little confession from him before my anger didst run over much and I became too hasty with the Builder's blade. I am convinced there was no further use for him, so I do not regret the loss, only that he failed to repent before he faced the Builder's judgment.
