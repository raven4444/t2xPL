Page_0: "Dear Mr. Rufus,
I know you've been so kind to us recently, but I'm afraid I have to ask your services once again. Once more, our portcullis lever has broken off. Would you mind fashioning us a new one? Since we provided you with a general access key as par your request, it would be most helpful if you could enter the Square after business hours to fix it up. I do believe the City Watch would grant permission for you to run an errand at night, wouldn't they? You may not even need to come inside, as the lever device is actually outside as you remember."

Page_1: "I have the sneaking suspicion that it is that delinquent up on the top floor causing the problems. I haven't seen him in months, and now that his advance rent payments are all used up, I bet he's trying to sabotage us. In any case, I'm evicting him, so hopefully these problems will cease. Would you care to relocate? The spot on the top floor is a little isolated, but I'm sure it would suit a man of your talents. We certainly require them often enough in the Square with all our shops nearby.

Regards,
Superintendent Bloomingsworth"
