   When you get back from Shalebridge tonight I want you to grab a few guys and clean out the barge. The last time I was in the dock area the stench of the rigor mortis was enough to gag a burrick tamer. I know the slave trade has picked up quite a bit, but Truart isn't going to continue paying top dollar for vagrants who smell like they're already dead - and believe me, he keeps a detailed record in that stupid journal of his. Throw the bodies into the cove and collect any personal effects that may have been left behind by the others. I run a clean operation and I won't have our vessels littered with corpses and such. See to it.

Neeson"
