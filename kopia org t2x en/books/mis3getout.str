No one's seen or heard from you in months. I don't own the building no more, so it's none of my business, but if you're going to be all secretive you should be less obvious about it. I know you've always kept odd hours with all sorts of unsavory folk, but I've never been one to judge or say anything. With all of the break-ins around here of late, folks are getting mighty suspicious, and I wouldn't be surprised if the Watch decide to drop in. Just be warned, I'd avoid doing business with those Free Traders for a while if I were you.
