Truart's getting pissy about the condition of the vagrants we've been turning over to him. We're going to have to be more careful. I got a good look at that little journal he carries with him everywhere. We were having drinks at Volari's and when he left to use the can, I flipped through it. Turns out he's been keeping a detailed 'file' of sorts on all the bums we've been delivering to him."

He's also been threatening to hang us both if he finds out we've been using our little arrangement to eliminate the competition. Between him and Limes, I'm starting to think we should have just let Kedar die, instead of pawning him off. I guess we're going to have to pay more attention to quality control from now on - just like with the artwork and spice. At least this is more steady.

N"
