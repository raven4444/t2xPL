     'Tis our second month in this wretched town. The name of the place belies the terrible weather, the foul disposition of the citizens, and the poor quality of food and hygiene in the place. Nevertheless, we gladly continue in the Builder's work. We hath secured a small passage in the sewers near the Hammerite Cathedral, close to what seemeth a secret entrance to a private area used only by the priests. 'Twas several days work bringing the iron beast into the depths, and we didst labor greatly with each piece, then assembled it in our small hideaway to guard and protect us from unwanted intrusions."

Fearing suspicion, we didst secure the services of a delivery boy who delivers perishable foods to the Hammer Cathedral. He was able to give us a great deal of information about the Hammer hierarchy and many intrigues taking place within the Sunnyport Order itself. Though he hath been scarce for ten and two days now, I shall wait to report our findings until we have spoken with him again.

By the strength of Karras,
Brother Stibbons"
