"Found a letter in the hallway today. Looked important, so I picked it up. It turned out to be from that mysterious Mr. Druart that the Madame has been so eager to impress lately. Except his name is not Druart, and he's not just a wealthy customer. I couldn't understand all the letter said, it was mostly politics, but the guy that Mr. Druart (or whatever his name is - he wrote that he was using a 'clever guise') was going to send the letter to must be one of the Lords. Lord K, now who could that be? This must mean that Mr. Druart is a very powerful man. I wish I knew more about politics; this is so exciting!"

"I heard Mr. Druart tell the Madame something really gross tonight (I was listening at the door, pretending to have dropped my necklace). He hangs people! Or has someone do it for him! Who is he?"

"I think I know who Mr. Druart is. I was about to ask the Madame today, but I just couldn't. What if she puts me back out on the street for being so nosy? Or gets HIM to do something horrible to me? No, it's best if I don't tell her."
