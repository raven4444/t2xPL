This morning I received a message. One of the healers from the other side of town, Sendor, hath discovered some sort of artifact there. He hath asked for our help. Strange, it seemeth, that he would write to us, the Hammers. These healers seemeth to value secrecy. I canst say that they seemed to like us when we questioned them upon their arrival all those weeks ago. And I canst help admit the feeling is mutual. I have long suspected they are up to some type of mischief. I have heard they have erected statues of some sort - could they be religious? Pagan perhaps? Or is it possible they worship that heathen god Linjala? Perhaps this Sendor has come to his senses and will give us license to terminate their activities."

It seemeth that the Hospital is plagued by foul undead; many of the recently deceased do return from their graves to haunt the healers. We must act swiftly. I have commandeered the local tavern and gathered here with my brethren to make final plans before storming the gates. It maketh me despair, how arrogant these healers are. That priestess... when we questioned her before she dared tell us that we are the ones who do not understand! That we dost not understand their ways and they dost not practice the black arts. Oh, we understandeth only too well how clever words and hollow phrases canst twist the minds of the weak. I regret that we hath waited so long to act. No good shall ever come of irreligion, even if it doth taketh the guise of a healer."
