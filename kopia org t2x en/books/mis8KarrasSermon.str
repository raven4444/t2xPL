page_0: "All must hear the words of Karras. My eyes have seen the vision of the Builder's Will, the breaking of the metal dawn. Why would not the Builder use all manner of tool and trade to shape his people? Is the Builder so small that his hand is only upon the hammer of our forbearers? The Builder hath created man with the ability to wield not only the mallet, but also the pen, not just the hammer, but the gear. Is the Builder of lesser matter than his own children? Are we not created in His image, to follow in His ways? How creative the works of the Builder appear to my eyes! He uses all manner of men, and all manner of tool to accomplish his purpose. He conforms all to His will. Why then will we be ashamed to do the same? Nay, brothers - we should be shamed if we fail to do likewise! Do not all men belong to the Builder? Does not the metal, and the very soil from which it comes, bear the mark of His great artistry?"

page_1: " Why then, my brothers, do we bind ourselves in the tradition of the Hammer, when the Builder has set no such bond upon us? Why do we shun the use of any manner of man, when the Builder has seen fit to use any man to His own glorious ends? We must loose ourselves from the shackles of our past, from our narrowness and hypocrisy and take up the new way! I have touched the tools of the builder - gear, steam, flame, earth, hammer, and yes, the cog - but none to the exclusion of the other. We must join together the bounty of His provision, to reach higher. For the sake of the Builder's Glory, and for the sake of this glorious calling He has placed upon each of us!"
