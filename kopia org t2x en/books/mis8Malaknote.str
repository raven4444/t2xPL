Page_0: "My shopkeeper associate sends word that you have recovered yet another precious shard found in the depths of the earth. This is good - for it means the Woodsie Lord is watching and guiding you in the shadows. This fire shard contains within it the power to take ordinary flame and turn it into the glowing magick of the wisp. Know that while this flame burns dim in comparison to true earth fire, it is a pure flame... and those impure creatures re-born of the pit will flee in terror in its wake. Of course, you can also use it to light the way, should you become lost."

Page_1: "To augment your strength on your journey I send to you a third shard to add to the one you have just stolen. With it, the fungus that grows so abundantly on your arrows of earth shall magickally be replaced with a pouch containing the spores of mushrooms found in our true home. These spores, when inhaled by an enemy, will warp and distort his mind, making him angry and violent toward any creature in his path. Of course, if the creature is naturally timid, he may but run if he has no means to defend himself. Use it wisely."

Page_2: "I also send a warning young Seeker. I have foreseen the wrath of the Hammer. Your actions at the Cathedral have left their order lusting for vengeance and they will attack anyone they regard as suspicious. Avoid them at all times my child. May the Woodsie Lord guide your way."
