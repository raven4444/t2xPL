     I write this in hope that the Builder will send a living soul to reclaim this letter. I do not understand why and how our expedition came to be, but I do understand that there was no possibility of our success. Most of our number were only acolytes and only two older brothers have been on the field of battle. We came unprepared, and now I have just learned... without proper equipment. Our hammers and arrows must lack the Builder's blessing upon them for the filthy undead kill us one by one.

     It is my will that my younger brother Seth inherit the hammer from my room in the seminary at Sunnyport. "

I am not sure how this ghastly puzzle is solved, but I now know that touching the wrong skull brings certain death. I stood too close as my arrow struck the blue one in the middle and now I lay fatally wounded. It is doubtful that any of us will live beyond this day, though it is clear that Onam intends to use us to the last man to accomplish his goal. I fear it is the mercy of the Builder that I meet my fate here, rather than by the horrors of what must surely lie ahead."
