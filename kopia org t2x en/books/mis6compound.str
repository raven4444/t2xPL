     Please remind the other priests that there are to be no acolytes in the rear compound. The initiates must gain a clear understanding of our hierarchy and permitting them to enter areas intended for the high ranking members of the Order will not accomplish this task. They are too young and reckless to gain a balanced understanding of the creature comforts and pleasure that the older members enjoy in the compound. At the proper time, they will be given admittance, but not until! All violators will be punished severely, both the initiate, and the priest from whom he obtained passage into the compound.
