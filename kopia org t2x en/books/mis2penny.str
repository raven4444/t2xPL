Page_0: "Dear Mr. Limes,
Your museum is a sham! The utter filth and inconceivable perversion that fills the fetid halls of your museum should be removed and the whole place turned into a factory or some other thing of use.

Your Trickster painting even shows him in the NUDE! This is vile, reprehensible, and wholly inappropriate. Not only that, but most of the paintings are frightening to behold. I do not say this merely because you turned down my own painting, 'Flowering Flower in Moonlight.' I say this to warn you of the young minds you are corrupting with your 'art.' Think twice before accepting any more of those crude sensationalist creations!

Pernillious Pennybuckle, Esq."
