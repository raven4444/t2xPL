Page_0: "Dear Mr. Smith,
I regret to inform you that that blundering fool Malloy has lost the key to the complex again. He probably got drunk and dropped it down a sewer pipe. I'm sure that you remember that this is not the first such occurrence, so we have therefore made the managerial decision to let him go. However, we're going to need another key made for his replacement. I would have gone to the smelters myself, but I know that city watch requests that you take care of and document all records of key transactions to market district buildings. I took the liberty of sending you the mold though so you don't have to walk across town and get it."

Page_1: "Would you ever considering moving in with us? It would be a great convenience having you in our market area up north, as we have such a high concentration of people. We have a vacancy now that Malloy is gone, and I believe we'll have another one shortly. One of my tenants upstairs disappeared months ago, and I think I'm just going to clean out his shop and rent it to someone else. You could have your pick of either place.

In any case, please let me know as soon as the new key is made.

Regards,
Superintendent Bloomingsworth"
