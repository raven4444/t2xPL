I must protect the Scales, yet it would be folly to think my summoned elementals could repel him. I can barely write this, my hands are shaking so. I fear I may have dropped precious writs on my return journey to my lair - but no matter. Truart is dead, and soon Viktoria will pay for banishing me. In death she will know her failure, but only too late, and see the truth of my ways. I will soon return and claim my rightful place as the redeemer of my people."

Page_1: "I confess to a small pang of regret in the girl's suffering over the fate of her cousin. A shame to lose such a well skilled pawn, but her sacrifice has served a greater cause, and she will now return to her simple way of life on distant shores. I failed to judge her mettle properly, for she lacked the passion to see her mission through to the end. No matter - her pain is of little consequence now. I have suffered myself in pursuit of the Beast to this place, but I am rewarded by my studies. I have learned to control the healing power of the Scales, a skill those inept 'healers' failed to master. Soon my preparations will be complete and I will be reunited with the Woodsie One. Then these manfools will honor my master in death, since they have failed to do so in life."

Page_2: "I must find a way to protect the Scales. They are still made of precious earth metal, susceptible to all of its flaws. Now that Truart is dead, I must contemplate a way to seal them from Viktoria's grasp, as she will surely try to destroy them. My power grows ever stronger, for I can see the Maw bleeding into what was once the ordinary grove outside this window. The lesser rats I have summoned now patrol its perimeter, and I can see how the grass and the vines have risen up out of the rock as never before. My influence overwhelms this creation, and soon Viktoria will pay for what she has done. Soon the prophecy will come to pass and all will be set right. The manfools will pay, and I will return their wasteland of steel and stone to the earth from which it came. The City lies within the palm of my hand. May the Woodsie Lord grant me blessing and wisdom."
