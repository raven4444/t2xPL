Within its small shard, and others like it, lies the power to distort the primordial essence of each element found in nature. You harvest these natural elements for use as weapons - as I have taught you - and now it is time to begin using them as they were intended. Each element is balanced. For each passive manifestation, there is an aggressive manifestation, for each aggressive manifestation, there is a passive one."

Page_1: "This first piece of crystal will mold your water arrows into the hardest, sharpest of ice ... ice only to be found naturally in The Maw. Use it to drive icy fear and pain into the hearts of your enemies, to halt them cold in their tracks. Use it to escape or move freely if there is a body of water nearby - for in water these arrows will create small islands for you to cross. Use the crystal again to change your ice hardened arrows back to ordinary water if you so desire. Use this power wisely, and I shall reward you with more of our magick in the future.
