Page_0: "Captain Neeson,
Creese says some Hammers came snooping around the Goodie Bag yesterday. I thought Hammers had to swear off candy once they converted? Maybe these two have a little secret. He says they snooped around the place a bit, real authoritative-like, then ordered a half pound of double mint fudge. Says they kept looking over their shoulders the whole time, real nervous. I almost wonder if they suspect something, but won't report it because they've got a little sweet tooth... Either way, we need to be more careful around there- maybe lay low on daytime activity for awhile."

Page_1: "The whole incident makes me wonder how much they really know. We can't afford to make them suspicious right now and we're really pushing things with all of the new recruits we got. The more I think about it though, the more we need them. Without their watching over things, the nobles wouldn't come to Sunnyport, and without all the fat cats, we'd lose our contacts and our cover. It's a might right shame we don't have somebody like Truart 'round here to bring in some real watch guards. They can be bought a whole lot easier than a Hammer."

Page_2: "I don't know how the Hammers keep pulling all of their recruits. Wouldn't seem like The Builder would have much say in a sin-filled, cold and nasty town like Sunnyport. Guess that huge, ominous cathedral they got at the north end is a sign of authority and power in and of itself. Whole situation just makes me wanna get liquored up. Anyway, you're the boss so I thought you should know.

Grissam"
