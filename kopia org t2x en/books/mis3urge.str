Page_0: "Dear Brethren of The Order of the Hammer,

I would like to encourage you yet again to lay down thine archaic and heavy hammers and take up arms with the new brethren, the children of Karras. The great prophet hath shown us the way to the gear, beyond the hammer, beyond the forge, and we are on the path to salvation you have not yet imagined. The Mechanists are yet small, but they are growing, dear brothers, with the aid of those like yourselves!"

Page_1: "See how thine building crumbles with decay? Dost thou think The Builder truly cherishes such rot? Join our new order; learn of the machine as it was meant to be. Give up thine attachment to the flesh and follow the true path. Let us embrace as brothers, and forget the old ways.

Write us quickly and tell us of your response dear brethren. The great Karras is willing to accept all who would come to him.

Acolyte Markus of The Mechanist Order"
