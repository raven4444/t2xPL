Damn hearty new year it was here. Half the boys passed out celebratin' the fact we're over twenty strong now. Been a right profitable year too. Ha! More men means less money for each of us. I prefer the old days, when it was just a few guys. Damn surprising the Hammers haven't caught on yet. We own this town! If it weren't for us, the whole damn place would close down."

Just delivered a beautiful Mizzahra Painting to Limes over at the museum in the City today. Old bugger acts all nervous around me lately. I hope somebody didn't open their yapper to him about the incident with that Kedar guy last year. It's just business, but these uppity white collar guys can get really funny when things get a bit violent. I'm gonna keep acting like nothing's wrong and hope he just had gas from lunch."

I don't care what Neeson says, I'm keeping the Gavant statue for myself. If our so called leader can 'borrow' acquisitions from the vault and lie to clients about it, I can damn well do the same. I've been collecting Gavants since I worked for Davidson and I'll never forgive myself if I let this piece go. Even as I write this, the boss is out with the harlots at Volari's, schmoozing with the sheriff, and Grissam is here sleeping off a hangover again. I should just go back to Davidson."
