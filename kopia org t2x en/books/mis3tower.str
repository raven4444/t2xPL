This business with the thieves in the Market District has gone too far. First Smegglers, and now a couple of workers from the Green Cyclops are reporting they haven't seen their neighbor Rathran in days. Truart has asked us to check it out first thing in the morning. If his store has been hit, I have a feeling we'll have a bigger problem on our hands. Still, I can't believe thieves could be that smart. The scene at Smegglers would seem to indicate that they're sloppy and overconfident."

After we check on that other store Hagan wants us to go down and see if we can find any clues. Frankly, I can't think of a place I'd want to be less. If our jobs weren't dangerous enough, now we have to risk wading in human waste. I'm sure you'll sleep well with that on your mind.
