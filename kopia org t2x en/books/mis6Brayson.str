       You were very wrong about the Hammers! In my few short weeks here in Sunnyport I already begun to realize how heretical the Mechanists are. Many of the acolytes here have similar feelings. The Hammer is the only true tool of the Builder, and we shall soon prove it! Several of us have been assigned to recover an old artifact from a mausoleum tomorrow. The older brothers seem to shake at the mere mention of the place, but we are not afraid. I shall write again when I return, with a great story of adventure which will restore your faith in the Order.
Love,
  Brayson"
