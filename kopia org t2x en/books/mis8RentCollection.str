   Here's this month's rent collection from the LeafDew street market. Picker says he'll be a bit late with the other half of his, but the rest of it is here. I'll be damned if I know how those guys at the Goodie Bag can afford what we're charging these days. Every time I'm in there they try to run me off. The clerks always look like they escaped from Cragscleft, but then I catch them standing around talking about opera and books - really weird stuff. I guess it doesn't matter so long as they come through every month. I'll take care of that roof leak at Xanra's Shoes sometime tomorrow.
