    This may come as a shock to you, but I have recently spent time investigating a certain tourist shop in town- 'The Goodie Bag' and have found it to be a front for a group of smugglers who have taken up residence in the caves and tunnels beneath Sunnyport. Though you believe yourself to have removed this threat from Sunnyport years ago, I assure you it still thrives. These thieves steal art and paintings, and I suspect they have even begun to practice slave trading. You will know that my words are true if you will but hurry to investigate the Goodie Bag this very morning, for these smugglers have acquired the Orb of St. Basmus, an artifact which I believe is of some value"

Sincerely,
A Concerned Citizen"
