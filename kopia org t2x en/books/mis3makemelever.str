Some drunken fool has gone and broken the lever to the service entrance again at Market Square. Bloomingsworth keeps sending requests for me to fix it every time it breaks, but I keep telling him your order is the only place in town with a working smelter. Could you please make him a winch that will fit as a favor to me? Send the bill directly to him and remind him I don't do levers. Perhaps he'll listen to one of your prestigious order and stop pestering me.

Cheerio
