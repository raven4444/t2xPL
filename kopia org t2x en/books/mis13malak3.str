She is yet too inexperienced for the difficult task of retrieving the Scales. Her journey of wrath has hardened her, prepared her for the perils of her trek into the Old Quarter. All for her cousin...a foolish mortal caught up in the foolish dealings of mortals. Will it pain her to know that her cousin will be the first sacrifice to my demon? No matter, others will sacrifice even more for the cause of the Woodsie Lord."

She no doubt thinks me evil, yet had it not been for my steady hand upon her path, she would never have realized her pitiful brand of justice upon her cousin's kidnappers. A trifling matter in the grand scope of all things. She thinks such justice satisfies the blood of the forgotten in this wretched City. Only the death of our true oppressor will bring such retribution. And then...then I shall have my own revenge. Truart will pay, as will Viktoria. Once they are removed, the City will be mine for the taking! The woodsie ones will have their reward, and I will be exalted to a place loftier than that from which I fell."
