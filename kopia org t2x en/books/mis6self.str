Brother Horman has not yet returned my favorite hammer. What is WRONG with the man? Has he no sense of decency? Why must I be forced to endure these placid, cow-like simpletons? This is absurd. I shall speak with him on the morrow and expound the virtues of timely returns. Idiots."

Not that the food was worth eating mind you, but why are they not being instructed in table manners? Our scholars reveal their growing incompetence by the day."

page_2: "Am I the only brother observant enough to notice the gaping disrepair in the Western roof of the Sanctuary belfries? Builder be, the rain, sleet, and snow pour in day after day, with naught a hint of concern from the priests or acolytes. I was reading up there yesterday and fear I may now be catching an ill breath from the wind that constantly buffeted my studies. Loafers!"

Yet, every week when my garments are returned washed and pressed, I find the same baggy and chaff inducing boxer shorts riding proudly atop the pile! Is the man really so dense? I went to have a word with him, but found his quarters locked up tight. I shall lodge a complaint within the week."
