I guess it's handy for some of the smaller spice runs, and I'm sure Feredoc gets a kick out of it - what with it being 'exotic' and such. Didn't we nab that thing back when all that mess with Limes was going on? Funny I haven't used it yet. Actually, come to think of it, I haven't been on any of the small spice runs in quite awhile."

What does he think he's doing??! Well, that prissy, over paid, glorified cat burglar won't get away with it!! I'm going to give him a piece of my mind!!"
