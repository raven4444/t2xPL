How do ya like the Free Traders so far? They're a tough buncha lads, but I'm sure you'll fit in just fine. Glad you decided to come and join us. Ma and Pa would still have you fetching ale for those hypocritical Hammers right now! It's not in every organization you get to learn to fight for yerself and travel about at the same time. Sure, hauling barrels up from the docks is tough, but everyone has to put in their share of sweat. Keep it up and you'll be out with me in the fresh air guarding the shop in Sunnyport."
