    For about two weeks now, I've noticed these darkly dressed, rough looking characters coming and going on the steam rail. I don't think any of them own shops around here, and hell if I know where they go. I haven't noticed anything strange around town, like the break-ins we had last winter, but it still makes me wonder...
    While I'm gone you can probably get away with closing at noon. In the off-season, the only thing people come here for is the gossip. I should have some juicy tidbits when I get back from the City. I'm hoping for a glimpse of this new Sheriff Truart, and to learn more about this Mechanist group."

"I even heard that this Karras person was here to see our very own Brother Cavador last week. He's supposedly quite popular in the City, and Doris says his voice is rich and deep - very romantic. I'll have lots to tell.

Take care,
Dinah"
