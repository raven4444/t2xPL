She supposedly remained imprisoned for 20 years in this secret hell. Deciding she would never escape, Lady Dionan threw herself from the tower and into the river below. This diary was found amongst her remains a short time later when they washed up in Shalebridge. To this day, no one has discovered the tower of which she spoke, and no one knows if this account is true or is simply the work of madness and delusion."
