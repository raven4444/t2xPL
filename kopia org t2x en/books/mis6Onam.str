page_0: "That idiot Gill! Has the man never poisoned anyone before? It was to be a simple task. Yet Cavador walks around as if in the health of youth! Either Gill has bumbled the job, or Cavador is truly protected by the Builder himself. The later is hardly likely considering his lackluster sermons as of late. This is a most curious turn of events."

page_1: "It seems as if the poison has only served to strengthen Cavador! I caught him returning to the compound tonight without any heavy clothing, but he seemed unaffected by the chilling wind. I can't think where he would go in this weather without his over-jacket, but I suspect it had little to do with the Builder's business. He claimed to have been retrieving books from the library, but when I asked him to show me what volumes he hath retrieved, he scoffed and hurried on his way. The man grows more apathetic in his convictions as the days go by. It is by the Builder's mercy that he will die soon, lest he receive a greater punishment for his continued complacency."

page_2: "Cavador is still in prime health and has assigned me to retrieve the Orb of St. Basmus from the Mausoleum! He claims the leadership in the City has commanded it, but I'm certain this is a plot to get rid of me. He has undoubtedly discovered my conspiracy with Gill and has planned some sort of ambush. I must be ever vigilant. He has assigned some of the new initiates to accompany me, but I am unsure as to their true spiritual state. Is it possible that Cavador has already corrupted them? This is extremely unfortunate. Tis madness to send me, a Bishop, into this undead territory with only novices at my side. The City shalt hear of this upon my return - if I cannot clear him out of the way, perhaps the order in the City will do it for me when they hear of this recklessness."
