Page_0: "Dear Curator Limes,
There hath been rumors that this new basement security system thou hath installed is influenced by blasphemous Mechanist technology. Why wouldst thou turn to these heretics when we hast made it perfectly clear that we wouldst be willing to aid you in such matters? Further, I hearest rumor that thou hast been inquiring about these heretical 'security cameras'? I pray tell that these rumors are not true, lest we may be inclined to perform a full investigation into thine museum. I daresay 'twould be bad for business to have members of your staff hauled to Cragscleft for penitence during the peak time of the year, wouldst it not?
