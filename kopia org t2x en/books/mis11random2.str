We have received several complaints from adjacent rooms about the noise late at night. Please be advised that any broken furniture or damage to the room will be reflected in your bill at check out. Furthermore, we remind you that there are designated lounges within the hotel, and the public lavatory is not one of them. Security has been notified of your lurking there and will take appropriate action if necessary. Please enjoy the remainder of your visit with us.
